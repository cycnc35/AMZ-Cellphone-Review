# AMZ-Cellphone-Review

This project is about to analyze consumers' opinions about cellphones they bought on Amazon.
Also, visualize results with visualization tool (i.g Matplotlib) to make results easy to realize.

## Libraries we need

1. Numpy
    - Numpy is a useful tool to handle vectors and matrix.
2. Pandas
    - Pandas is a library that can easily help us manipulate data.
3. Matplotlib
    - Matplotlib is a powerful visualization tool to help users understand the result easily.
4. Scikit-learn
    - Scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning which is useful for data analysis.
5. Keras
    - Keras is high level deep learning API that we can use it to build our own deep learning model.
6. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
    - NLTK is a tool that we can use to process text data into numbers which is input-friendly data type.

To install these libraries you can simply type the command below in your terminal:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
